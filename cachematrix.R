## Two functions here to solve the inverse of a matrix. 
## The result is cached, so that if the inverse of the same matrix is requested again,
## then the value is returned from cache, not recalculated.


## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache 
## its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse 
## from the cache. Basic syntax to calculate the inverse (B) of a matrix A is: B <- solve(A)

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        
        
}
